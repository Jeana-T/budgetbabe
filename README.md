budget tracker chrome extension

# Inspiration
  As almost-broke college students, we saw a lack of financial and budgeting literacy for people in the gen-z community 
  and felt it was imperative to create a project addressing this issue! We have all used budgeting techniques such as 
  spreadsheets and notebook trackers but all are forgotten quickly. We believe that a budget tracker Google Chrome extension 
  is an easily accessible, and clean tool to allow students to track their expenses daily.

# What it does
  Budget Babe allows:
  - The user to set a budget which is displayed in the popup
  - Input the amount of money spent
  - Add a cost to their total spent amount directly from a webpage (think online shopping!)
  - Choose a category for spending

How I built it
  I built this using html, css, js, json, and jquery.

Accomplishments that I'm proud of
  This is our first time building a chrome extension and exploring web development. We are proud of our design clarity 
  and the clean easy-to-use interface, which makes our project appealing to our target audience.

What I learned
  Through extensive debugging and research, we learned that to be able to develop a functional and aesthetically-pleasing 
  project, it is important to be persistent and patient with every obstacle we encounter. On a technical level, we gained 
  exposure to JSON and learned more about web-based development.

What's next for Budget Babe
  In the future, we hope to implement more features to better aide our audience. We plan to include data visualization of 
  user spending, make the extension more personalized for the individual (implement adding category feature, pick the 
  color scheme, etc.).
  
 Although the idea was born @ Rose Hack, we are just getting started. We want to continue building Budget Babe and hopefully 
 make a positive impact on our audience!
